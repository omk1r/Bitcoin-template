            <p>Bitcoin is the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency. It enables peer-to-peer exchange of value
                in the digital realm through the use of a decentralized protocol, cryptography, and a mechanism to
                achieve global consensus on the state of a periodically updated public transaction ledger called a
                blockchain. </p><br>
            <p>Launched anonymously in January 2009 to a niche group of technologists, Bitcoin is now a globally traded
                financial asset with daily settled volume measured in the tens of billions of dollars. Although its
                regulatory status varies by region and continues to evolve, Bitcoin is most commonly regulated as either
                a currency or a commodity, and is legal to use (with varying levels of restrictions) in all major
                economies. In June 2021, El Salvador became the first country to mandate Bitcoin as legal tender. </p>

        <p>
        Bitcoin is based on the ideas laid out in a 2008 whitepaper titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The paper detailed methods for "allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party."The technologies deployed solved the 'double spend' problem, enabling scarcity in the digital environment for the first time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The listed author of the paper is Satoshi Nakamoto, a presumed pseudonym for a person or group whose true identity remains a mystery. Nakamoto released the first open-source Bitcoin software client on January 9th,2009, and anyone who installed the client could begin using Bitcoin
